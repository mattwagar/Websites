Descriptions:

Breathless: The Space Pirate, Aria, is on a mission to loot a mineral cargo ship. However, upon landing
on the cargo ship, Aria's helmet cracks causing her to slowly lose oxygen. It's now a race against time to collect
all the gems before her oxygen runs out!  

Breathless is a 2D Platformer made in the modern HTML5 game engine, Phaser.js. As a group project for my Introduction to Video
Game Design at Drexel University, me and a team of five collaborated in a psuedo Agile Environement for five weeks. 
I was in charge of coding many of the core mechanics such as the player movement, phyiscs, rocket boost, particle effects, and parallax background.
I also contributed to the art by pixelating the background, tileset, and particle animations.

Mean Weather: Weather App

As a crash course in Angular JS, Web API's and D3.js, I decided to create a weather app that calculates the average of 4 weather services:
Wunderground, Forecast.io, Yahoo weather, and World Weather Online. The webapp itself has many subtleties that are affected by weather
data. For example, the video background resembles the current weather. Also each graph is color coated by a gradient based on the 
weather data.
